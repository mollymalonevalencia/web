		<h1>MOLLY MALONE</h1>	
<pre>
In Dublin’s fair city, 
where the girls are so pretty, 
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone.
As she wheeled her weel-barrow 
througth the streets broad and narrow, 
crying “Cockles and mussels, 
alive, alive, oh!”

“Alive, alive, oh!,
alive, alive, oh!”,
crying “cockles and mussels,
alive, alive, oh!”

She was a fishmonger, 
and sure t’was no wonder,
for so were her mother and father before.
And they wheeled their barrow,
througth the streets broad and narrow, 
crying “Cockles and mussels, 
alive, alive, oh!”

“Alive, alive, oh!,
alive, alive, oh!”,
crying “cockles and mussels,
alive, alive, oh!”

She died of a feber, 
and sure so one could save her,
and that was the end of sweet Molly Malone.
Now her ghost wheels her barrow
througth the streets broad and narrow, 
crying “Cockles and mussels, 
alive, alive, oh!”

(x2)
“Alive, alive, oh!,
alive, alive, oh!”,
crying “cockles and mussels,
alive, alive, oh!”
