		<h1>WILD ROVER</h1>
		<pre>
And it's no, nay, never
No, nay never no more
will I play the wild rover
No, never no more.

I’ve been a wild rover 
for many’s the year 
and I’ve spent all me money 
on whiskey and beer.

But now I’m returning 
with gold in great store 
and I never will play 
the wild rover no more. 

And it’s no, nay, never. 
No, nay, never no more 
Will I play the wild rover 
no, never no more.

I then took from me pocket 
ten sovereigns bright,
and the land-lady’s eyes 
opened wide with de light.

She says “I have wiskeys 
and wines of the best”, 
And the words that you told me 
were only in jest. 

And it’s no, nay, never. 
No, nay, never no more 
Will I play the wild rover 
no, never no more.

I’ll home to my parents, 
confess what I’d done, 
and I’ll ask them to pardon 
their prodigal son.

And when they have caressed me
as of times before, 
I never will play 
the wild rover no more 

(x2)
And it’s no, nay, never. 
No, nay, never no more 
Will I play the wild rover 
no, never no more.
