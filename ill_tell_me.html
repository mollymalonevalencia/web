		<h1>I’LL TELL ME MA</h1>
		<pre>
I’ll tell me ma, when I go home, 
The boys won’t leave the girls alone.
They pull my hair, they stole my comb,
but that’s all right ‘till I go home. 
She is handsome, she is pretty, 
she’s the belle of Belfast City, 
she’s acourting one two three, 
please won’t you tell me who is she?

Albert Mooney says he loves her, 
all the boys are after her.
Rap at the door and ring on the bell.
Oh, my true love, are you well?
Out she comes as white as snow, 
rings on her fingers and bells on her toes.
We, Jenny Murray says she’ll die 
if she doesn’t get the fellow 
with the roving eye.

I’ll tell me ma, when I go home, 
The boys won’t leave the girls alone.
They pull my hair, they stole my comb,
but that’s all right ‘till I go home. 
She is handsome, she is pretty, 
she’s the belle of Belfast City, 
she’s acourting one two three, 
please won’t you tell me who is she?

A skipping she’s the best of all, 
She never slips, she never falls.
Double Dutch or Heel and Toe, 
She’s the one that steals the snow.
When they all come out to play
she’s the one that leads the way.
And Albert Mooney’s always there 
to see the girl with the Golden hair.

I’ll tell me ma, when I go home, 
The boys won’t leave the girls alone.
They pull my hair, they stole my comb,
but that’s all right ‘till I go home. 
She is handsome, she is pretty, 
she’s the belle of Belfast City, 
she’s acourting one two three, 
please won’t you tell me who is she?

Let the wind and the rain 
and the hail blow high
and the snow come tumbling from the sky.
She’s as nice as apple pie, 
and she’ll get her own lad by and by.
When she gets a lad of her own
she won’t thell her ma when she comes home.
Let them all come as they well
for it’s Albert Mooney she loves still.
